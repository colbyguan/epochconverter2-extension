# epochconverter2_extension

I got tired of opening up a completely new tab at work just to convert relative timestamps, so this is a port of my [epochconverter2 tool](https://epochconverter2.colby.cc/) to being a Firefox add-on / Chrome extension. Most testing is done in Firefox.

## Firefox install (temporary add-on)

See the [MDN docs on installing a temp add-on](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Your_first_WebExtension#installing), and choose `build/manifest.json` as the file to open

Unfortunately I think this current method will make the extension disappear on restart. Perhaps I will get to resolving that one day.
